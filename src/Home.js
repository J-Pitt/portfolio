        </h2>
        <p>My name is Jason and I have been working in the adops and adtech engineering industry for over three years. I got my 
        start at sovrn holdings llc in their adops department, working with the account management and sales teams to help publishers
        create ad tags, align demand, and identify and remedy any ad serving issues. I then helped build out their support engineering 
        team to provide support for prebid.js, along with other engineering related support. In addition to provide header bidding support, 
        I also assisted our ad trafficking team with DSP integrations, pixel tracking and cookiesync integrations, and container tag management.</p>
 
        <p>After that, I transitioned to a sales engineering role with Amazon Publisher Servies, within the A9 unit. Here, I have been 
        primarily supporting both their Transparent Ad Marketplace and Unified Ad Marketplace products, helping publishers integrate successfully, 
        and building new features to help increase the value of these products.</p>
